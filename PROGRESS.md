## Current milestone: publish existing results

Status: published and verified at https://kunming-cn.github.io/END2END_Ge_Simulation/

Verified on the development computer:
- Installed Git 2.55.0.3 and GitHub CLI 2.101.0.
- Repaired old workspace paths in 379 text/configuration/scene files. Originals are in one ignored `.local/migration-originals.zip`.
- All 17 model files match their recorded SHA-256 hashes; referenced baseline files exist where required.
- Replayed the AK01 fixed event with Julia 1.13.0 / SSD 0.11.8: 239 waveform samples, maximum difference from the saved waveform 0.0.
- Loaded and rendered the AK01 and GeGI fixed-event ParaView scenes from the new location.
- Built a public-only website: 17 detectors, approximately 180 MB. Original fields and event binary caches were not recomputed or modified.
- Browser check: 17 homepage detector cards; GeGI has 20 selectable events; changing event/time and selecting all 34 channels works without JavaScript exceptions.
- Added the earlier GeGI notebook results and octagon geometry illustration. Manufacturer PDFs and the photograph remain local.

These are migration and functionality checks, not all-detector convergence tests or experimental validation.

## Remaining work, in order

| Milestone | Deliverable | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | Share existing results on GitHub Pages | Published; URL verified |
| M1 | Clean-machine calculation example, pinned environment, portable paths | Next |
| M2 | One Geant4/remage event connected to SSD drift and electrode signal | Planned |
| M3 | Preamp, analog shaping, ADC, independently reconstructed event energy | Planned |
| M4 | Small repeatable spectrum and documented event-level checks | Planned |
| M5 | Physics/readout refinements and comparison with measured data | Planned |

Known portability work: the original GeGI model/cache and one benchmark still reference external local directories; these references currently exist but are not distributed. Some native build scripts also name the installed ParaView/Julia executables. The website does not depend on these paths. Do not describe M1 as complete or upgrade SSD without a separate compatibility check.

## Approved execution settings

The maintainer approved the staged plan and requested Astra High for Work/Codex development tasks on 2026-09-25. The local Codex user config was inspected and already specifies `model = "gpt-6-astra"` and `model_reasoning_effort = "high"`; these existing settings were preserved. The cached model catalog lists High as supported. The preference is recorded in AGENTS.md. No Work/Codex development task was launched by this configuration check.

## Publication maintenance review — 2026-09-25

Plan approved before edits: preserve the existing calculation workspace; stage and validate web exports before replacing docs/; add portable link/privacy/inventory checks; verify the exact deployed build instead of a homepage string; clarify web-only usage. Do not install Geant4 or change scientific inputs. Review, test, and commit this as one publication-maintenance change.

Maintenance implemented: staged export, previous-snapshot protection, read-only generated-folder cleanup, deterministic public manifest, a browser-specific guide, and a portable standard-library validator. Seven guard tests passed, including failed-export preservation. The snapshot has 21 HTML pages and 1,629 checked local links (1,014 content files plus the manifest; approximately 180 MB). A repeat build returned the identical build ID and did not rewrite docs/. Exact live verification of this maintenance update is the remaining publication check.

The public snapshot is still a results release, not a portable solver. The original calculation inputs and binary outputs were not modified in this maintenance step.
